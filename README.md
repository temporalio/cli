> ⚠️ Temporal CLI's API is still subject to change. ⚠️

The Temporal CLI is a tool for interacting with Temporal from the command line.
Temporal CLI functions as a distribution of the Temporal Server and Web UI that runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies.
The tool supports persistence to disk and in-memory mode through SQLite.

## Installation

Temporal CLI can be installed through several different methods. While most of them can be used across all operating systems, please note that Homebrew is macOS-exclusive.

### cURL

Run the following command to install the latest version of Temporal CLI.

`curl -sSf https://temporal.download/cli.sh | sh`

### Homebrew

Run the following command in a new terminal window to install CLI for macOS.

`brew install temporal`

### GitHub releases

Download and extract the latest release from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/temporalio/cli/releases).

### CDN

To install the Temporal CLI from CDN:

1. Select the binary with the corresponding platform and architecture of your system.
2. Download the binary.
3. Extract the downloaded archive.
4. Add the `temporal` binary to your system PATH.

## Starting the Temporal Server

Run the command provided below to start the Temporal Server.
This will automatically start the Web UI.

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

At this point you should have a server running on `localhost:7233` and a web interface at <http://localhost:8233>.
A default Namespace has also been created.

Run individual commands to interact with the local Temporal server.

```bash
temporal operator namespace list
temporal workflow list
```

## Configuration

Use the help flag to see a full list of CLI options:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --help
```

Configure the environment with `env` commands:

```bash
temporal env set [environment options]
```

### Namespace registration

Namespaces are pre-registered at startup so they're available to use right away.
To customize the pre-registered namespaces, start the server with:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --namespace foo --namespace bar
```

You can also register Namespaces with the following command:

```bash
temporal operator namespace create foo
```

### Persistence modes

By default, `temporal server start-dev` runs in an in-memory mode.

To persist the state to a file on disk, use `--db-filename`:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --db-filename my_test.db
```

### Enable or disable Temporal UI

By default, the Temporal UI is started with Temporal CLI. The UI can be disabled via a runtime flag:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --headless
```

To build without static UI assets, use the `headless` build tag when running `go build`.

<!--TODO: add go example -->

### Dynamic configuration

Advanced configuration of the Temporal CLI requires the use of a dynamic configuration file.
This file is created outside of the Temporal CLI; it is usually located with the service's config files.

Dynamic configuration values can also be set via `--dynamic-config-value KEY=JSON_VALUE`.
For example, to disable the search attribute cache, run:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --dynamic-config-value system.forceSearchAttributesCacheRefreshOnRead=true
```

This setting makes created search attributes immediately available for use.

## Auto-completion

The Temporal CLI has the capability to auto-complete commands.

Running `temporal completion SHELL` will output the related completion SHELL code.

### zsh auto-completion

<!-- TODO: add more information about zsh to make comparable to bash section -->

Add the following code snippet to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```sh
source <(temporal completion zsh)
```

If you're running auto-completion from the terminal, run the command below:

```sh
echo 'source <(temporal completion zsh)' >> ~/.zshrc
```

After setting the variable, run:

`source ~/.zshrc`.

### Bash auto-completion

Bash auto-completion relies on `bash-completion`.

Install the software with the steps provided [here](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion#installation), or use your preferred package manager on your operating system.

#### Linux installation

Use any of the following package managers to install `bash-completion`:
`apt install bash-completion`
`pacman -S bash-completion`
`yum install bash-completion`

Verify that `bash-completion` is installed by running `type _init_completion`.

To install the software on Alpine Linux, run:

```bash
apk update
apk add bash-completion
source /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh
```

Finally, enable completion for Temporal by adding the following code to your bash file:

```
echo 'source <(temporal completion bash)' >>~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### macOS installation

Install `bash-completion` through Homebrew:
`brew install bash-completion@2`

Add the provided code snippet to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```sh
[[ -r "/usr/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh" ]] && . "/usr/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh"
```

Verify that `bash-completion` is installed by running `type _init_completion`.

Enable completion for Temporal by adding the following code to your bash file:

```
echo 'source <(temporal completion bash)' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Development

The Temporal CLI can be compiled and executed from your system.

To compile the source code into an executable, run:

```bash
go build -o dist/temporal ./cmd/temporal
```

To compile the documentation, run:

```bash
go build -o dist/temporal-docgen ./cmd/temporal-docgen
```

To run all tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

## Known Issues

- When consuming Temporal as a library in go mod, you may want to replace grpc-gateway with a fork to address URL escaping issue in UI. See <https://github.com/temporalio/temporalite/pull/118>

- When running the executables from the Releases page in macOS you will want to allowlist `temporal` binary in `Security & Privacy` settings:
