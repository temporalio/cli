# This document is automatically parsed.
# Follow these rules.

# IN-HOUSE STYLE

# * Wording and grammar:
#   * Run a spell check.
#   * Be clear and concise.
#   * Don't reword the command in the summary. Use distinct supplementary language.
#     * Yes: temporal workflow delete: Remove Workflow Execution
#     * No: temporal workflow delete: Delete Workflow
#   * Re-use and adapt existing wording and phrases wherever possible.
#   * Word command summaries as if they began "This command will..."
#     Use sentence casing for the summary.
#   * ID is fully capitalized in text ("the Workflow ID") and Id in
#     [metasyntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable) (YourWorkflowId).
# * Avoid parentheticals unless absolutely necessary.

# * Wrapping:
#   * Assume a user-visible line length of 80 characters max. `fmt -w 78` can help.
#     * Long descriptions must be pre-wrapped.
#   * When declaring Options follow the wrapping style used elsewhere in this file.
#     Splitting the items into multiple lines improves maintainability with clearer diffs.

# * Punctuation:
#   * End description blocks with a period.
#     Do _not_ use periods for summaries.
#   * Introduce triple-quoted code-fenced samples with a colons.
#     Avoid using 'for example' unless there's no other way to introduce code.

# * Code, flags, and keys:
#   * Demonstrate at least one example invocation of the command in every long description.
#   * Include the most commonly used patterns in long descriptions so users don't
#     have to call help at multiple invocation levels.
#   * Avoid deprecated period-delineated versions of environment-specific keys.
#     * Yes:
#           ```
#           temporal env set \
#               --env prod \
#               --key tls-cert-path \
#               --value /home/my-user/certs/cluster.cert
#           ```
#     * No: `temporal env set prod.tls-cert-path /home/my-user/certs/cluster.cert`.
#   * Split invocation samples to multiple lines.
#     Use one option or flag per line, as in the above example.
#     Use a single space and a backslash to continue the invocation.
#     Use 4-space indentation.
#   * Always use long options and flags for invocation examples.
#     * Yes: `--namespace`
#     * No:  `-n`
#   * When commands have a single command-level option, include it the mandatory example.
#   * Use square bracket overviews to present how complex commands will be used.
#     * Yes: temporal operator [command] [subcommand] [options]
#     Commands with subcommands can't be run on their own unless
#     subcommands-optional is set to true.
#     Because of this, always use full command examples.
#   * Use square brackets to highlight optional elements, especially when long
#     descriptions would suffer from two very similar command invocations.
#     * Yes: temporal operator cluster describe [--detail]
#   * Use YourEnvironment, YourNamespace, etc. as unquoted metasyntactic variable
#     stand-ins.
#     Respectful metasyntax describes the role of the stand-in.
#     * Yes: --workflow-id YourWorkflowId
#     * No: --workflow-id your-work-id, --workflow-id "
#   * For JSON input, use single quotes to encase interior double quotes.
#     Otherwise, in the rare case it is needed, prefer double quotes.
#   * When presenting options use a space rather than equal to set them.
#     This is more universally supported and consistent with POSIX guidelines.
#     * Yes: `temporal command --namespace YourNamespace`.
#     * No: `temporal command --namespace=YourNamespace`.
#     Note: in this utility's current incarnation, Boolean options must be
#     set with an equal sign.
#     Since Booleans can be treated like flags, avoid using assigned values in samples.
#     * Yes: `--detail`
#     * No: `--detail=true`

# For options and flags:

# * When options and flags can be passed multiple times, say so explicitly in
#   the usage text: "Can be passed multiple times."
# * Never rely on the flag type (e.g. `string`, `bool`, etc.) being shown to the user.
#   It is replaced/hidden when a `META-VARIABLE` is used.
# * Where possible, use a `META-VARIABLE` (all caps and wrapped in `\``s) to
#   describe/reference content passed to an option.
# * Limit `code spans` to meta-variables.
#   To reference other options or specify literal values, use double quotes.

    summary: Pause an Activity
    description: |
      Pause an Activity.

      If the Activity is not currently running (e.g. because it previously
      failed), it will not be run again until it is unpaused.

      However, if the Activity is currently running, it will run until the next
      time it fails, completes, or times out, at which point the pause will kick in.

      If the Activity is on its last retry attempt and fails, the failure will
      be returned to the caller, just as if the Activity had not been paused.

      Activities should be specified either by their Activity ID or Activity Type.

      For example, specify the Activity and Workflow IDs like this:

      ```
      temporal activity pause \
          --activity-id YourActivityId \
          --workflow-id YourWorkflowId
      ```

      To later unpause the activity, see [unpause](#unpause). You may also want to
      [reset](#reset) the activity to unpause it while also starting it from the beginning.

    summary: Unpause an Activity
    description: |
      Re-schedule a previously-paused Activity for execution.

      If the Activity is not running and is past its retry timeout, it will be
      scheduled immediately. Otherwise, it will be scheduled after its retry
      timeout expires.

      Use `--reset-attempts` to reset the number of previous run attempts to
      zero. For example, if an Activity is near the maximum number of attempts
      N specified in its retry policy, `--reset-attempts` will allow the
      Activity to be retried another N times after unpausing.

      Use `--reset-heartbeat` to reset the Activity's heartbeats.

      Activities can be specified by their Activity ID or Activity Type.
      One of those parameters must be provided.

      Specify the Activity ID or Type and Workflow IDs:

      ```
      temporal activity unpause \
          --activity-id YourActivityId \
          --workflow-id YourWorkflowId
          --reset-attempts
          --reset-heartbeats
      ```

      Activities can be unpaused in bulk via a visibility Query list filter.
      For example, if you want to unpause activities of type Foo that you
      previously paused, do:

      ```
      temporal activity unpause \

      reset will take effect the next time it fails, heartbeats, or times out.
      If is waiting for a retry (i.e. has failed or timed out), the reset
      will apply immediately.

      If the activity is already paused, it will be unpaused by default.
      You can specify `keep_paused` to prevent this.

      If the activity is paused and the `keep_paused` flag is not provided,
      it will be unpaused. If the activity is paused and `keep_paused` flag
      is provided - it will stay paused.

      Activities can be specified by their Activity ID or Activity Type.

      ### Resetting activities that heartbeat {#reset-heartbeats}

      Activities that heartbeat will receive a [Canceled failure](/references/failures#cancelled-failure)
      the next time they heartbeat after a reset.

      If, in your Activity, you need to do any cleanup when an Activity is
      reset, handle this error and then re-throw it when you've cleaned up.

      If the `reset_heartbeats` flag is set, the heartbeat details will also be cleared.

      Specify the Activity Type of ID and Workflow IDs:

      ```
      temporal activity reset \
          --activity-id YourActivityId \
          --workflow-id YourWorkflowId
          --keep-paused
          --reset-heartbeats
      ```

      Either `activity-id`, `activity-type`, or `--match-all` must be specified.

      Activities can be reset in bulk with a visibility query list filter. 
      For example, if you want to reset activities of type Foo:

      ```
      temporal activity reset \
          --query 'TemporalResetInfo="property:activityType=Foo"'
      ```

      Remove a Worker Deployment Version given its fully-qualified identifier.
      This is rarely needed during normal operation
      since unused Versions are eventually garbage collected.
      The client can delete a Version only when all of the following conditions
      are met:
        - It is not the Current or Ramping Version for this Deployment.
        - It has no active pollers, i.e., none of the task queues in the
        Version have pollers.
        - It is not draining. This requirement can be ignored with the option
      `--skip-drainage`.

      Set the Current Version for a Deployment.
      When a Version is current, Workers of that Deployment Version will receive
      tasks from new Workflows, and from existing AutoUpgrade Workflows that
      are running on this Deployment.

      If not all the expected Task Queues are being polled by Workers in the
      new Version the request will fail. To override this protection use
      `--ignore-missing-task-queues`. Note that this would ignore task queues
      in a deployment that are not yet discovered, leading to inconsistent task
      queue configuration.

      ```
      temporal worker deployment set-current-version [options]

      ```
      temporal worker deployment set-current-version \

      Set the Ramping Version and Percentage for a Deployment.

      The Ramping Version can be set using deployment name and build ID,
      or set to unversioned workers using the --unversioned flag.

      The Ramping Percentage is a float with values in the range [0, 100].
      A value of 100 does not make the Ramping Version Current, use
      `set-current-version` instead.

      To remove a Ramping Version use the flag `--delete`.

      If not all the expected Task Queues are being polled by Workers in the
      new Ramping Version the request will fail. To override this protection use
      `--ignore-missing-task-queues`. Note that this would ignore task queues
      in a deployment that are not yet discovered, leading to inconsistent task
      queue configuration.

      ```
      temporal worker deployment set-ramping-version [options]
      ```

      For example, to set the Ramping Version of a deployment
      `YourDeploymentName`, with a version with Build ID `YourBuildID`, with
      10 percent of tasks redirected to this version, and
      using the default namespace:

      ```
      temporal worker deployment set-ramping-version \
          --deployment-name YourDeploymentName --build-id YourBuildID \
          --percentage 10.0
      ```

      And to remove that ramping:
      ```
      temporal worker deployment set-ramping-version \
          --deployment-name YourDeploymentName --build-id YourBuildID \

  - name: temporal schedule backfill
    summary: Backfill past actions
    description: |
      Batch-execute actions that would have run during a specified time interval.
      Use this command to fill in Workflow runs from when a Schedule was paused,
      before a Schedule was created, from the future, or to re-process a previously
      executed interval.

      Backfills require a Schedule ID and the time period covered by the request.
      It's best to use the `BufferAll` or `AllowAll` policies to avoid conflicts
      and ensure no Workflow Executions are skipped.

      For example:

      ```
      temporal schedule backfill \
          --schedule-id "YourScheduleId" \
          --start-time "2022-05-01T00:00:00Z" \
          --end-time "2022-05-31T23:59:59Z" \
          --overlap-policy BufferAll
      ```

      The policies include:

      * **AllowAll**: Allow unlimited concurrent Workflow Executions. This
        significantly speeds up the backfilling process on systems that support
        concurrency. You must ensure running Workflow Executions do not interfere
        with each other.
      * **BufferAll**: Buffer all incoming Workflow Executions while waiting for
        the running Workflow Execution to complete.
      * **Skip**: If a previous Workflow Execution is still running, discard new
        Workflow Executions.
      * **BufferOne**: Same as 'Skip' but buffer a single Workflow Execution to be
        run after the previous Execution completes. Discard other Workflow
        Executions.
      * **CancelOther**: Cancel the running Workflow Execution and replace it with
        the incoming new Workflow Execution.
      * **TerminateOther**: Terminate the running Workflow Execution and replace
        it with the incoming new Workflow Execution.

    summary: Create a new Schedule
    description: |
      Create a new Schedule on the Temporal Service. A Schedule automatically starts
      new Workflow Executions at the times you specify.

      For example:

      ```
        temporal schedule create \
          --schedule-id "YourScheduleId" \
          --calendar '{"dayOfWeek":"Fri","hour":"3","minute":"30"}' \
          --workflow-id YourBaseWorkflowIdName \
          --task-queue YourTaskQueue \
          --type YourWorkflowType
      ```

      Schedules support any combination of `--calendar`, `--interval`, and `--cron`:

      * Shorthand `--interval` strings.
        For example: 45m (every 45 minutes) or 6h/5h (every 6 hours, at the top of
        the 5th hour).
      * JSON `--calendar`, as in the preceding example.
      * Unix-style `--cron` strings and robfig declarations
        (@daily/@weekly/@every X/etc).
        For example, every Friday at 12:30 PM: `30 12 * * Fri`.

  - name: temporal task-queue describe
    summary: Show active Workers
    description: |
      Display a list of active Workers that have recently polled a Task Queue. The
      Temporal Server records each poll request time. A `LastAccessTime` over one
      minute may indicate the Worker is at capacity or has shut down. Temporal
      Workers are removed if 5 minutes have passed since the last poll request.

      ```
      temporal task-queue describe \
        --task-queue YourTaskQueue
      ```

      This command provides poller information for a given Task Queue.
      Workflow and Activity polling use separate Task Queues:

      ```
      temporal task-queue describe \
          --task-queue YourTaskQueue \
          --task-queue-type "activity"
      ```

      This command provides the following task queue statistics:
      - `ApproximateBacklogCount`: The approximate number of tasks backlogged in this
        task queue. May count expired tasks but eventually converges to the right
        value.
      - `ApproximateBacklogAge`: Approximate age of the oldest task in the backlog,
        based on its creation time, measured in seconds.
      - `TasksAddRate`: Approximate rate at which tasks are being added to the task
        queue, measured in tasks per second, averaged over the last 30 seconds.
        Includes tasks dispatched immediately without going to the backlog
        (sync-matched tasks), as well as tasks added to the backlog. (See note below.)
      - `TasksDispatchRate`: Approximate rate at which tasks are being dispatched from
        the task queue, measured in tasks per second, averaged over the last 30
        seconds.  Includes tasks dispatched immediately without going to the backlog
        (sync-matched tasks), as well as tasks added to the backlog. (See note below.)
      - `BacklogIncreaseRate`: Approximate rate at which the backlog size is
        increasing (if positive) or decreasing (if negative), measured in tasks per
        second, averaged over the last 30 seconds.  This is roughly equivalent to:
        `TasksAddRate` - `TasksDispatchRate`.

      NOTE: The `TasksAddRate` and `TasksDispatchRate` metrics may differ from the
      actual rate of add/dispatch, because tasks may be dispatched eagerly to an
      available worker, or may apply only to specific workers (they are "sticky").
      Such tasks are not counted by these metrics. Despite the inaccuracy of
      these two metrics, the derived metric of `BacklogIncreaseRate` is accurate
      for backlogs older than a few seconds.

      Safely retire Workers assigned a Build ID by checking reachability across
      all task types. Use the flag `--report-reachability`:

      ```
      temporal task-queue describe \
          --task-queue YourTaskQueue \
          --select-build-id "YourBuildId" \
          --report-reachability
      ```

      Task reachability information is returned for the requested versions and all
      task types, which can be used to safely retire Workers with old code versions,
      provided that they were assigned a Build ID.

      Note that task reachability status is experimental and may significantly change
      or be removed in a future release. Also, determining task reachability incurs a
      non-trivial computing cost.

      Task reachability states are reported per build ID. The state may be one of the
      following:

      - `Reachable`: using the current versioning rules, the Build ID may be used
        by new Workflow Executions or Activities OR there are currently open
        Workflow or backlogged Activity tasks assigned to the queue.
      - `ClosedWorkflowsOnly`: the Build ID does not have open Workflow Executions
        and can't be reached by new Workflow Executions. It MAY have closed
        Workflow Executions within the Namespace retention period.
      - `Unreachable`: this Build ID is not used for new Workflow Executions and
        isn't used by any existing Workflow Execution within the retention period.

      Task reachability is eventually consistent. You may experience a delay until
      reachability converges to the most accurate value. This is designed to act
      in the most conservative way until convergence. For example, `Reachable` is
      more conservative than `ClosedWorkflowsOnly`.

      temporal task-queue versioning commit-build-id \
          --task-queue YourTaskQueue
          --build-id "YourBuildId"
      ```

      This command automatically applies the following atomic changes:

      - Adds an unconditional assignment rule for the target Build ID at the
        end of the list.
      - Removes all previously added assignment rules to the given target
        Build ID.
      - Removes any unconditional assignment rules for other Build IDs.

      Rejects requests when there have been no recent pollers for this Build ID.
      This prevents committing invalid Build IDs. Use the `--force` option to
      override this validation.

      Task Queues support the following versioning rules:

      - Assignment Rules: manage how new executions are assigned to run on specific
        Worker Build IDs. Each Task Queue stores a list of ordered Assignment Rules,
        which are evaluated from first to last. Assignment Rules also allow for
        gradual rollout of new Build IDs by setting ramp percentage.
      - Redirect Rules: automatically assign work for a source Build ID to a target
        Build ID. You may add at most one redirect rule for each source Build ID.
        Redirect rules require that a target Build ID is fully compatible with
        the source Build ID.

      Modify properties of Workflow Executions:

      ```
      temporal workflow update-options [options]
      ```

      It can override the Worker Deployment configuration of a
      Workflow Execution, which controls Worker Versioning.

      For example, to force Workers in the current Deployment execute the
      next Workflow Task change behavior to `auto_upgrade`:

      ```
      temporal workflow update-options \
          --workflow-id YourWorkflowId \
          --versioning-override-behavior auto_upgrade
      ```

      or to pin the workflow execution to a Worker Deployment, set behavior
      to `pinned`:

      ```
      temporal workflow update-options \
          --workflow-id YourWorkflowId \
          --versioning-override-behavior pinned \
          --versioning-override-deployment-name YourDeploymentName \
          --versioning-override-build-id YourDeploymentBuildId
      ```

      To remove any previous overrides, set the behavior to
      `unspecified`:

      ```
      temporal workflow update-options \
          --workflow-id YourWorkflowId \
          --versioning-override-behavior unspecified
