# This document is automatically parsed.
# Follow these rules.

# IN-HOUSE STYLE

# * Wording and grammar.
#   * Run a spell check.
#   * Be clear and concise.
#   * Don't reword the command in the summary. Use distinct supplementary language.
#     * Yes: temporal workflow delete: Remove Workflow Execution
#     * No: temporal workflow delete: Delete Workflow
#   * Re-use and adapt existing wording and phrases wherever possible.
#   * Word command summaries as if they began "This command will..."
#     Use sentence casing for the summary.
#   * ID is fully capitalized in text ("the Workflow ID") and Id in 
#     [metasyntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable) (YourWorkflowId).
# * Avoid parentheticals unless absolutely necessary.

# * Wrapping:
#   * Assume a user-visible line length of 80 characters max. `fmt -w 78` can help.
#     * Long descriptions must be pre-wrapped.
#   * When declaring Options follow the wrapping style used elsewhere in this file.
#     Splitting the items into multiple lines improves maintainability with clearer diffs.

# * Punctuation:
#   * End description blocks with a period.
#     Do _not_ use periods for summaries.
#   * Introduce triple-quoted code-fenced samples with a colons.
#     Avoid using 'for example' unless there's no other way to introduce code.

# * Code, flags, and keys
#   * Demonstrate at least one example invocation of the command in every long description.
#   * Include the most commonly used patterns in long descriptions so users don't 
#     have to call help at multiple invocation levels.
#   * Avoid deprecated period-delineated versions of environment-specific keys.
#     * Yes:
#           ```
#           temporal env set \
#               --env prod \
#               --key tls-cert-path \
#               --value /home/my-user/certs/cluster.cert`
#           ```
#     * No: `temporal env set prod.tls-cert-path /home/my-user/certs/cluster.cert`.
#   * Split invocation samples to multiple lines.
#     Use one option or flag per line, as in the above example.
#     Use a single space and a backslash to continue the invocation.
#     Use 4-space indentation.
#   * Always use long options and flags for invocation examples.
#     * Yes: `--namespace`
#     * No:  `-n`
#   * When commands have a single command-level option, include it the mandatory example.
#   * Use square bracket overviews to present how complex commands will be used.
#     * Yes: temporal operator [command] [subcommand] [options]
#     Commands with subcommands can't be run on their own.
#     Because of this, always use full command examples.
#   * Use square brackets to highlight optional elements, especially when long 
#     descriptions would suffer from two very similar command invocations.
#     * Yes: temporal operator cluster describe [--detail]
#   * Use YourEnvironment, YourNamespace, etc. as unquoted metasyntactic variable 
#     stand-ins.
#     Respectful metasyntax describes the role of the stand-in.
#     * Yes: --workflow-id YourWorkflowId
#     * No: --workflow-id your-work-id, --workflow-id "
#   * For JSON input, use single quotes to encase interior double quotes.
#     Otherwise, in the rare case it is needed, prefer double quotes.
#   * When presenting options use a space rather than equal to set them.
#     This is more universally supported and consistent with POSIX guidelines.
#     * Yes: `temporal command --namespace YourNamespace`.
#     * No: `temporal command --namespace=YourNamespace`.
#     Note: in this utility's current incarnation, Boolean options must be 
#     set with an equal sign.
#     Since Booleans can be treated like flags, avoid using assigned values in samples.
#     * Yes: `--detail`
#     * No: `--detail=true`

# For options and flags:

# * When options and flags can be passed multiple times, say so explicitly in 
#   the usage text: "Can be passed multiple times."
# * Never rely on the flag type (e.g. `string`, `bool`, etc.) being shown to the user.
#   It is replaced/hidden when a `META-VARIABLE` is used.
# * Where possible, use a `META-VARIABLE` (all caps and wrapped in `\``s) to 
#   describe/reference content passed to an option.
# * Limit `code spans` to meta-variables.
#   To reference other options or specify literal values, use double quotes.

# COMMAND ENTRY OVERVIEW

# OPTION SET OVERVIEW

# An options set declaration is the equivalent of pasting those options into the 
# bulleted options list.

# - name: The name of the option set. (string)
#   options: A list of options. Same template as Command options above (Option[])

# Options that are similar but slightly different don't need to be in option sets.
# Reserve option sets for when the behavior of the option is the same across commands.

    summary: Manage environments
    description: |
      Environments manage key-value presets, auto-configuring Temporal CLI options
      for you. You can set up distinct environments like "dev" and "prod" for
      convenience:

      ```
      temporal env set \
          --env prod \
          --key address \
          --value production.f45a2.tmprl.cloud:7233
      ```

      Each environment is isolated. Changes to "prod" presets won't affect "dev".

      For easiest use, set a `TEMPORAL_ENV` environment variable in your shell. The
      Temporal CLI checks for an `--env` option first, then checks for the
      `TEMPORAL_ENV` environment variable. If neither is set, the CLI uses the
      "default" environment.

      Batch-execute actions that would have run during a specified time interval.
      Use this command to fill in Workflow runs from when a Schedule was paused,
      before a Schedule was created, from the future, or to re-process a previously
      executed interval.

      Backfills require a Schedule ID and the time period covered by the request.
      It's best to use the `BufferAll` or `AllowAll` policies to avoid conflicts
      and ensure no Workflow Executions are skipped.

      For example:

      ```
        temporal schedule backfill \
          --schedule-id "YourScheduleId" \
          --start-time "2022-05-01T00:00:00Z" \
          --end-time "2022-05-31T23:59:59Z" \
          --overlap-policy BufferAll
      ```

      The policies include:

      * **AllowAll**: Allow unlimited concurrent Workflow Executions. This
        significantly speeds up the backfilling process on systems that support
        concurrency. You must ensure running Workflow Executions do not interfere
        with each other.
      * **BufferAll**: Buffer all incoming Workflow Executions while waiting for
        the running Workflow Execution to complete.
      * **Skip**: If a previous Workflow Execution is still running, discard new
        Workflow Executions.
      * **BufferOne**: Same as 'Skip' but buffer a single Workflow Execution to be
        run after the previous Execution completes. Discard other Workflow
        Executions.
      * **CancelOther**: Cancel the running Workflow Execution and replace it with
        the incoming new Workflow Execution.
      * **TerminateOther**: Terminate the running Workflow Execution and replace
        it with the incoming new Workflow Execution.

      ```

      Schedules support any combination of `--calendar`, `--interval`, and `--cron`:

      * Shorthand `--interval` strings.
        For example: 45m (every 45 minutes) or 6h/5h (every 6 hours, at the top of
        the 5th hour).
      * JSON `--calendar`, as in the preceding example.
      * Unix-style `--cron` strings and robfig declarations
        (@daily/@weekly/@every X/etc).
        For example, every Friday at 12:30 PM: `30 12 * * Fri`.

          --task-queue YourTaskQueue
      ```

      For example:

      ```
      temporal task-queue describe \
          --task-queue YourTaskQueue
      ```
    option-sets:

    summary: Show active Workers
    description: |
      Display a list of active Workers that have recently polled a Task Queue. The
      Temporal Server records each poll request time. A `LastAccessTime` over one
      minute may indicate the Worker is at capacity or has shut down. Temporal
      Workers are removed if 5 minutes have passed since the last poll request.

      ```
      temporal task-queue describe \
        --task-queue YourTaskQueue
      ```

      This command provides poller information for a given Task Queue.
      Workflow and Activity polling use separate Task Queues:

      ```
      temporal task-queue describe \
          --task-queue YourTaskQueue \
          --task-queue-type "activity"
      ```

      This command provides the following task queue statistics:
      - `ApproximateBacklogCount`: The approximate number of tasks backlogged in this
        task queue. May count expired tasks but eventually converges to the right
        value.
      - `ApproximateBacklogAge`: Approximate age of the oldest task in the backlog,
        based on its creation time, measured in seconds.
      - `TasksAddRate`: Approximate rate at which tasks are being added to the task
        queue, measured in tasks per second, averaged over the last 30 seconds.
        Includes tasks dispatched immediately without going to the backlog
        (sync-matched tasks), as well as tasks added to the backlog. (See note below.)
      - `TasksDispatchRate`: Approximate rate at which tasks are being dispatched from
        the task queue, measured in tasks per second, averaged over the last 30
        seconds.  Includes tasks dispatched immediately without going to the backlog
        (sync-matched tasks), as well as tasks added to the backlog. (See note below.)
      - `Backlog Increase Rate`: Approximate rate at which the backlog size is
        increasing (if positive) or decreasing (if negative), measured in tasks per
        second, averaged over the last 30 seconds.  This is equivalent to:
        `TasksAddRate` - `TasksDispatchRate`.

      NOTE: The `TasksAddRate` and `TasksDispatchRate` metrics may differ from the
      actual rate of add/dispatch, because tasks may be dispatched eagerly to an
      available worker, or may apply only to specific workers (they are "sticky").
      Such tasks are not counted by these metrics.

      Safely retire Workers assigned a Build ID by checking reachability across
      all task types. Use the flag `--report-reachability`:

      ```
      temporal task-queue describe \
        --task-queue YourTaskQueue \
        --build-id "YourBuildId" \
        --report-reachability
      ```

      Task reachability information is returned for the requested versions and all
      task types, which can be used to safely retire Workers with old code versions,
      provided that they were assigned a Build ID.

      Note that task reachability status is experimental and may significantly change
      or be removed in a future release. Also, determining task reachability incurs a
      non-trivial computing cost.

      Task reachability states are reported per build ID. The state may be one of the
      following:

      - `Reachable`: using the current versioning rules, the Build ID may be used
        by new Workflow Executions or Activities OR there are currently open
        Workflow or backlogged Activity tasks assigned to the queue.
      - `ClosedWorkflowsOnly`: the Build ID does not have open Workflow Executions
        and can't be reached by new Workflow Executions. It MAY have closed
        Workflow Executions within the Namespace retention period.
      - `Unreachable`: this Build ID is not used for new Workflow Executions and
        isn't used by any existing Workflow Execution within the retention period.

      Task reachability is eventually consistent. You may experience a delay until
      reachability converges to the most accurate value. This is designed to act
      in the most conservative way until convergence. For example, `Reachable` is
      more conservative than `ClosedWorkflowsOnly`.

      temporal task-queue versioning commit-build-id \
          --task-queue YourTaskQueue
          --build-id "YourBuildId"
      ```

      This command automatically applies the following atomic changes:

      - Adds an unconditional assignment rule for the target Build ID at the
        end of the list.
      - Removes all previously added assignment rules to the given target
        Build ID.
      - Removes any unconditional assignment rules for other Build IDs.

      Rejects requests when there have been no recent pollers for this Build ID.
      This prevents committing invalid Build IDs. Use the `--force` option to
      override this validation.

      Task Queues support the following versioning rules:

      - Assignment Rules: manage how new executions are assigned to run on specific
        Worker Build IDs. Each Task Queue stores a list of ordered Assignment Rules,
        which are evaluated from first to last. Assignment Rules also allow for
        gradual rollout of new Build IDs by setting ramp percentage.
      - Redirect Rules: automatically assign work for a source Build ID to a target
        Build ID. You may add at most one redirect rule for each source Build ID.
        Redirect rules require that a target Build ID is fully compatible with
        the source Build ID.

      `--input`, that data is available for the Workflow Execution to consume:

      ```
      temporal workflow signal \
          --workflow-id YourWorkflowId \
          --name YourSignal \
          --input '{"YourInputKey": "YourInputValue"}'
      ```

      The reason is optional and defaults to the current user's name. The reason
      is stored in the Event History as part of the `WorkflowExecutionTerminated`
      event. This becomes the closing Event in the Workflow Execution's history.

      Executions may be terminated in bulk via a visibility Query list filter:

      ```
      temporal workflow terminate \
          --query YourQuery \
          --reason YourReasonForTermination
      ```

      Workflow code cannot see or respond to terminations. To perform clean-up work
      in your Workflow code, use `temporal workflow cancel` instead.
