## cancel

Canceling a running Workflow Execution records a
`WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested` event in the Event History. The Service
schedules a new Command Task, and the Workflow Execution performs any cleanup
work supported by its implementation.

Use the Workflow ID to cancel an Execution:

```
temporal workflow cancel \
    --workflow-id YourWorkflowId
```

A visibility Query lets you send bulk cancellations to Workflow Executions
matching the results:

```
temporal workflow cancel \
    --query YourQuery
```
