## describe

Display a list of active Workers that have recently polled a Task Queue. The
Temporal Server records each poll request time. A `LastAccessTime` over one
minute may indicate the Worker is at capacity or has shut down. Temporal
Workers are removed if 5 minutes have passed since the last poll request.

```
temporal task-queue describe \
  --task-queue YourTaskQueue
```

This command provides poller information for a given Task Queue.
Workflow and Activity polling use separate Task Queues:

```
temporal task-queue describe \
    --task-queue YourTaskQueue \
    --task-queue-type "activity"
```

This command provides the following task queue statistics:
- `ApproximateBacklogCount`: The approximate number of tasks backlogged in this
  task queue. May count expired tasks but eventually converges to the right
  value.
- `ApproximateBacklogAge`: Approximate age of the oldest task in the backlog,
  based on its creation time, measured in seconds.
- `TasksAddRate`: Approximate rate at which tasks are being added to the task
  queue, measured in tasks per second, averaged over the last 30 seconds.
  Includes tasks dispatched immediately without going to the backlog
  (sync-matched tasks), as well as tasks added to the backlog. (See note below.)
- `TasksDispatchRate`: Approximate rate at which tasks are being dispatched from
  the task queue, measured in tasks per second, averaged over the last 30
  seconds.  Includes tasks dispatched immediately without going to the backlog
  (sync-matched tasks), as well as tasks added to the backlog. (See note below.)
- `BacklogIncreaseRate`: Approximate rate at which the backlog size is
  increasing (if positive) or decreasing (if negative), measured in tasks per
  second, averaged over the last 30 seconds.  This is roughly equivalent to:
  `TasksAddRate` - `TasksDispatchRate`.

NOTE: The `TasksAddRate` and `TasksDispatchRate` metrics may differ from the
actual rate of add/dispatch, because tasks may be dispatched eagerly to an
available worker, or may apply only to specific workers (they are "sticky").
Such tasks are not counted by these metrics. Despite the inaccuracy of 
these two metrics, the derived metric of `BacklogIncreaseRate` is accurate
for backlogs older than a few seconds.

Safely retire Workers assigned a Build ID by checking reachability across
all task types. Use the flag `--report-reachability`:

```
temporal task-queue describe \
    --task-queue YourTaskQueue \
    --build-id "YourBuildId" \
    --report-reachability
```

Task reachability information is returned for the requested versions and all
task types, which can be used to safely retire Workers with old code versions,
provided that they were assigned a Build ID.

Note that task reachability status is experimental and may significantly change
or be removed in a future release. Also, determining task reachability incurs a
non-trivial computing cost.

Task reachability states are reported per build ID. The state may be one of the
following:

- `Reachable`: using the current versioning rules, the Build ID may be used
  by new Workflow Executions or Activities OR there are currently open
  Workflow or backlogged Activity tasks assigned to the queue.
- `ClosedWorkflowsOnly`: the Build ID does not have open Workflow Executions
  and can't be reached by new Workflow Executions. It MAY have closed
  Workflow Executions within the Namespace retention period.
- `Unreachable`: this Build ID is not used for new Workflow Executions and
  isn't used by any existing Workflow Execution within the retention period.

Task reachability is eventually consistent. You may experience a delay until
reachability converges to the most accurate value. This is designed to act
in the most conservative way until convergence. For example, `Reachable` is
more conservative than `ClosedWorkflowsOnly`.

Provides commands to add, list, remove, or replace Worker Build ID assignment
and redirect rules associated with Task Queues:

```
temporal task-queue versioning [subcommands] [options] \
    --task-queue YourTaskQueue
```

Task Queues support the following versioning rules and policies:

- Assignment Rules: manage how new executions are assigned to run on specific
  Worker Build IDs. Each Task Queue stores a list of ordered Assignment Rules,
  which are evaluated from first to last. Assignment Rules also allow for
  gradual rollout of new Build IDs by setting ramp percentage.
- Redirect Rules: automatically assign work for a source Build ID to a target
  Build ID. You may add at most one redirect rule for each source Build ID.
  Redirect rules require that a target Build ID is fully compatible with
  the source Build ID.

    --build-id "YourBuildId"
```

This command automatically applies the following atomic changes:

- Adds an unconditional assignment rule for the target Build ID at the
  end of the list.
- Removes all previously added assignment rules to the given target
  Build ID.
- Removes any unconditional assignment rules for other Build IDs.

Rejects requests when there have been no recent pollers for this Build ID.
This prevents committing invalid Build IDs. Use the `--force` option to
override this validation.

## versioningget-rules

Retrieve all the Worker Build ID assignments and redirect rules associated
with a Task Queue:

```
temporal task-queue versioning get-rules \
    --task-queue YourTaskQueue
```

Task Queues support the following versioning rules:

- Assignment Rules: manage how new executions are assigned to run on specific
  Worker Build IDs. Each Task Queue stores a list of ordered Assignment Rules,
  which are evaluated from first to last. Assignment Rules also allow for
  gradual rollout of new Build IDs by setting ramp percentage.
- Redirect Rules: automatically assign work for a source Build ID to a target
  Build ID. You may add at most one redirect rule for each source Build ID.
  Redirect rules require that a target Build ID is fully compatible with
  the source Build ID.
