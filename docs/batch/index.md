## batch

Operations performed on Batch jobs. Use Workflow commands with --query flag to start batch jobs.

>Batch jobs run in the background and affect Workflow Executions one at a time. In `cli`, the batch commands are used to view the status of Batch jobs, and to terminate them. A successfully started Batch job returns a Job Id, which is needed to execute batch commands. Terminating a batch job does not roll back the operations already performed by the job itself.
