Operator commands enable actions on [Namespaces](/namespaces), [Search Attributes](/visibility#search-attribute), and [Temporal Clusters](/clusters).
These actions are performed through subcommands for each Operator area.

To run an Operator command, run `temporal operator [command] [subcommand] [command options] [arguments]`.
