Schedule commands allow the user to create, use, and update [Schedules](/workflows#schedule).
Schedules control when certain Actions for a Workflow Execution are performed, making it a useful tool for automation.

To run a Schedule command, run `temporal schedule [command] [command options] [arguments]`.
